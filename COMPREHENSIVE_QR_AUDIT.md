## Proposed Solution Architecture

### 1. Guard Registration System

#### QR Code Registration Flow
```
[QR Code Generated by Admin] → [Guard Scans] → [Profile Setup] → [Account Activation]
```

**Implementation:**
- Admin generates time-limited registration QR codes
- QR contains encrypted registration token
- Mobile app scans QR and opens registration form
- Form includes: Photo, ID verification, emergency contacts
- Automatic role assignment based on QR code type

**Database Schema:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE registration_qr_codes (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    token VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE,
    role_id UUID REFERENCES roles(id),
    site_id UUID REFERENCES sites(id),
    created_by UUID REFERENCES users(id),
    expires_at TIMESTAMP,
    max_uses INTEGER DEFAULT 1,
    used_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
    metadata JSONB
);
```

### 2. Enhanced Attendance System

#### Clock-In/Out with Verification
```
[Guard Scans QR] → [Location Verification] → [Photo Capture] → [Clock In/Out Recorded]
```

**Features:**
- GPS radius verification (within 50m of assigned location)
- Mandatory selfie for identity verification
- Offline capability with sync when online
- Geofencing alerts for unauthorized locations
- Automatic break time tracking

**Mobile Interface:**
```typescript
interface AttendanceSession {
  id: string;
  userId: string;
  siteId: string;
  clockInTime: Date;
  clockOutTime?: Date;
  gpsCoordinates: [number, number];
  verificationPhoto: string;
  qrCodeId: string;
  status: 'active' | 'completed' | 'missed';
  totalHours?: number;
}
```

### 3. Patrol Checkpoint System

#### QR/NFC Patrol Scanning
```
[Guard Starts Patrol] → [Scans Checkpoints] → [Reports Issues] → [Completes Patrol]
```

**Implementation:**
- Predefined patrol routes with mandatory checkpoints
- QR codes + NFC tags at each checkpoint
- Photo evidence requirement for incidents
- Voice notes for additional context
- Real-time client notifications

**Database Schema:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE patrol_checkpoints (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    site_id UUID REFERENCES sites(id),
    name VARCHAR(255),
    description TEXT,
    qr_code VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE,
    nfc_tag_id VARCHAR(255),
    gps_coordinates POINT,
    is_mandatory BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
    estimated_duration INTEGER, -- minutes
    instructions TEXT
);

CREATE TABLE patrol_scans (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    patrol_session_id UUID REFERENCES patrol_sessions(id),
    checkpoint_id UUID REFERENCES patrol_checkpoints(id),
    guard_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
    scanned_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    scan_method ENUM('qr', 'nfc', 'manual'),
    gps_coordinates POINT,
    photo_evidence TEXT[],
    notes TEXT,
    issues_reported BOOLEAN DEFAULT false
);
